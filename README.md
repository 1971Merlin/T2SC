TEC to Southnern Cross Bus Adaptor

A small KICad project to Adapt the Talking Electronics TEC-1 computer to the IO expansion bus used by the Southern Cross SC-1, Micrprofessor MPF-1 and similar computers.

Basically, this adaptor breaks out the Z80 CPU's 40 pins directly to an IO connector. There is no bufffering, it is a staight signal path.

The IDC connecor pin numbering has been done in an unconventional "antclickwise" approach, to match the CPU pin numbering.

### MPF-1 Bus connector

Note the different pin numbering convention, but the actual pin locations are identical.
